# Geometric-Particle-Packing
The initial implementations of an approach to obtain a set of particles with a prescribed filling ratio and size distribution using the geometric separation particle packing technique. The final results and methods are described in the paper "A geometric separation method for non-uniform disk packing with prescribed filling ratio and size distribution" (DOI :10.1007/s40571-020-00320-x).
